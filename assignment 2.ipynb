And just because you are intelligent, it does not mean you should have a good memory. However, there are exceptions to these rules. Humans begin learning by memorizing. After few years, he realizes that mere capability to memorize is not intelligence. Then he practices on transforming the data stored in memory to knowledge and applies them to develop skills to solve problems faced in real life. A person with good memory and more knowledge without the required skills cannot be considered intelligent. Search engines replaces human memory and these days the focus is on acquiring intelligence by making use of data available on the web. In humans, learning speed depends on individuals and in machines, learning speed depends on the algorithm selected and the volume of examples exposed to it."
