Obviously, we benefit from these algorithms, otherwise, we wouldn’t be using them in the first place. These algorithms allow us to automate processes by making informed judgments using available data. Sometimes, however, this means replacing someone’s job with an algorithm, which comes with ethical ramifications.\n",

Neural networks are data-eating machines that require copious amounts of training data. The larger the architecture, the more data is needed to produce viable results. Reusing data is a bad idea, and data augmentation is useful to some extent, but having more data is always the preferred solution.\n",

    "1.Supervised learning In supervised learning, the machine is taught by example. The operator provides the machine learning algorithm with a known dataset that includes desired inputs and outputs, and the algorithm must find a method to determine how to arrive at those inputs and outputs. While the operator knows the correct answers to the problem, the algorithm identifies patterns in data, learns from observations and makes predictions. The algorithm makes predictions and is corrected by the operator – and this process continues until the algorithm achieves a high level of accuracy/performance.\n",

    "2.Unsupervised learning Here, the machine learning algorithm studies data to identify patterns. There is no answer key or human operator to provide instruction. Instead, the machine determines the correlations and relationships by analysing available data. In an unsupervised learning process, the machine learning algorithm is left to interpret large data sets and address that data accordingly. The algorithm tries to organise that data in some way to describe its structure. This might mean grouping the data into clusters or arranging it in a way that looks more organised. As it assesses more data, its ability to make decisions on that data gradually improves and becomes more refined.\n",

Dimension reduction: Dimension reduction reduces the number of variables being considered to find the exact information required."
