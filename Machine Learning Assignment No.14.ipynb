    "**Solution:-** Supervised machine learning is a method of solving machine learning problems by training a machine learning model using a labelled data. Labelled data would mean that for every nth set of values for i number of independent variables, a value x would be present belonging to the dependent variable where, value of x can belong to countably finite or uncountably infinite set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance of the name is that the name itself explains that there will be some form of supervision working on machine learning. The labelled data acts as a supervision for machine learning as class labels or target variable values have been manually fed or generated from past records."
